#  MindSphere SDK for .NET

Open-source .NET SDK for [MindSphere](https://siemens.mindsphere.io/) APIs mainly to support backend development in [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore).

❗ **Project is still a work in progress. Following features are done or being developed** ❗
- authentication using AppCredentials
- listing assets
- adding new assets
- getting time series data
- putting new time series data
- extension method for ServiceCollection to register SDK as service

This project was started on my own initiative. I am still a student and I am trying my best to develop useful solution for the absence of .NET SDK. Of course, any help is more than welcome.

My goal is the develop SDK that provides at least same features as MindSphere SDK for [Node.js](https://developer.mindsphere.io/resources/mindsphere-sdk-node/index.html)

## Examples
Examples of the current state of the project. Some of them might change in the future.
