#  MindSphere SDK for .NET

Open-source .NET SDK for [MindSphere](https://siemens.mindsphere.io/) APIs.


*This project was started on my own initiative. I am still a student and I am trying my best to develop useful solution for the absence of .NET SDK. Of course, any help is more than welcome. My goal is to develop SDK similar to [MindSphere SDK for Node.js](https://developer.mindsphere.io/resources/mindsphere-sdk-node/index.html).*
